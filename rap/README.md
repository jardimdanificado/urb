# rap
rap is the urb language, it is **COMPLETELY EXPERIMENTAL AND UNSTABLE**.

while rap itself is meant to be very readable and easy, its source is a nightmare for most people, if you are not familiarized with m4 i dont recommend you to read rap language source, especially the .m4 files.

both preprocessors are avaliable in rap, but always prefer m4, cpp is not as powerful and is the last to be used;

rap has no versioning, i cant even decide which is its main file, probably syntax.m4?

## requirements

in case you using the urb language you will need:
- a linux enviroment(optional, but preferred)
- a *gcc compatible* C compiler
- GNU m4, i guess other m4 implementation might work as well
- perl
